                    <p>We lead busy lives, but being busy doesn't necessarily mean we're being productive. Productive
                        means that we're using our time wisely by focusing on what matters. Monthly Migration helps us
                        accomplish this by weeding out distractions.</p>

                    <p>From our signature collection. Each notebook has a hardcover bound with PU leather (100%
                        vegan) with a duck finely debossed on the cover. Printed on the inside cover of the notebook
                        are duck footprints that are so cute, you just want to tickle them.
                        Our paper? Well, we are the oldest established paper company in Lebanon and the
                        region, we know a thing or two about paper. Each page of 100gsm silk cream acid free
                        fountain-friendly FSC-certified paper is micro-perforated with a total of 96 sheets or 192
                        pages. And our notebooks open as flat as a pancake.
                        <br><br>The paper used is acid-free, a depiction of longevity, archive-ability and
                        preservation.
                        <br><br>Yes, yes, of course they have an inner pocket, bookmark and an elastic closure!
                        Oh, almost forgot to mention the pen holder, just perfect.</p>

                    <img class="right-element" id="pens-pic" src="pics/Pen.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>I've experimented with different brands of gel pens over the years, but I keep coming back to the
                        Pilot G2. The G2 is one of those pens that people either love or hate - I think a lot of the
                        hate comes from the fact that Pilot advertises it as the "world's most popular pen" or something
                        like that, and people (especially on the Internet) love a good takedown of whatever's popular.
                        But there are many reasons this pen deserves that title: it's widely available (including in
                        drug and grocery stores), it's comes in various tip sizes and ink colors, and it's a dependable
                        writer that doesn't dry up or skip. </p><br>

                    <img class="left-element" id="full-pic" src="pics/full.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>At the very end of each month, set up a new Monthly Log. Once that's done, review the pages of
                        the month gone by. Chances are, you didn't get around to completing all your Tasks. That's fine!
                        What's important is figuring out which incomplete Tasks are worth your limited time and energy
                        moving forward. Strike out those that aren't, and migrate the ones that are.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        To Migrate a Task, simply turn the “•” into “>” to indicate that you’ve moved that Task forward
                        onto the Task Page of your new Monthly Log or into an appropriate Collection. If you wrote down
                        a book title for example, you would migrate that entry into your "Books to Read" Collection.
                        Once you've Migrated open Tasks, check your Future Log. See if any Tasks or Events listed there
                        have become current. If so, migrate those entries from your Future Log into your new Monthly
                        Log.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It may seem like a lot of effort to have to rewrite all these things, but that’s intentional.
                        This process makes you pause and consider each item. If an entry isn’t even worth the effort to
                        rewrite it, then it’s probably not that important. Get rid of it. The purpose of Migration is to
                        surface what's worth the effort, become aware of our actions, and to separate the signal from
                        the noise. This is where BuJo shifts from a system, into the practice...
