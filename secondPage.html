                    <p>From our signature collection. Each notebook has a hardcover bound with PU leather (100%
                        vegan) with a duck finely debossed on the cover. Printed on the inside cover of the notebook
                        are duck footprints that are so cute, you just want to tickle them.
                        <br><br>Our paper? Well, we are the oldest established paper company in Lebanon and the
                        region, we know a thing or two about paper. Each page of 100gsm silk cream acid free
                        fountain-friendly FSC-certified paper is micro-perforated with a total of 96 sheets or 192
                        pages. And our notebooks open as flat as a pancake.
                        <br><br>The paper used is acid-free, a depiction of longevity, archive-ability and
                        preservation.

                        <h1>Message from the Founder:</h1><br>
                        <i>“My great great grandfather established one of the first paper shops in Lebanon in the
                            early 19th century, trading high quality paper more or less continuously from then until
                            the present day. I passionately believe that there’s still a place for this most
                            traditional of materials in today’s high speed, digital world. Sometimes you need
                            something that’s more tactile – more personal. Our wide range of Dingbats* Notebooks
                            lets you choose the design, material and colour that reflects your own personality.”
